# Quiz-Brain
A simple yet engaging command-line Quiz App built with Python. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming and logic flow control through a fun, interactive quiz.


ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Loads questions from a structured data file (quiz_data.py)
- Uses custom Question and QuizBrain classes for clean, modular design
- Interactive user input with True/False validation
- Score tracking and final results display
- Simple to expand with more questions or new formats


ðŸ§  How It Works
1. quiz_data.py contains a list of dictionaries with questions and correct answers.
2. main.py reads these into Question objects.
3. QuizBrain loops through questions and handles user interaction and scoring.
